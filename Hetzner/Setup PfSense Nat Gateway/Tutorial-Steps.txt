1- Login to Hetzner cloud console
2- Create your new project
3- Go to "Network"
4- Create Your Network
    - 10.10.0.0/16 <-- Can be anything you feel valid, but keep in mind IPs in the steps are to be changed accordingly.
5- Enter the newly created network, and create your subnets, My preferred is 3 subnets (App, Data and Public. can be as many as you like though)
    - 10.100.10.0/24  <-- Apps Subnet
    - 10.100.20.0/24  <-- Data Subnet
    - 10.100.100.0/24  <-- Public Subnet
6- Go to servers and create a new server with public IP (Can be any O.S for now)
    - Server MUST be of CX Family, CPX Family for some reason does not detect HDD when setting up PfSense.
    - Preferred Type CX21 (2 CPU, 4GB Memory)
    - If you do not plan on setting up A VPN solution on it, Use CX11 (1 CPU, 2GB Memory)
    - Remove IPv6 Public
    - Name The server Something Meaningful (PfSense-Gateway)
    - Take A Note of the public IP.
7- Go back to network, And Attach it to the Public Subnet
    - Assign it a static IP (10.10.100.250)
8- Go Back to the created server, ISO Images tab, Search and mount pfSense CE 2.7.0 (amd64)
9- Enter Console, Click on Ctrl+Alt+Del, This will reboot the server and Boot the iso, Wait for it to complete booting
10- Do The Setup with the following steps
    - Accept Copyright Notice
    - Select Install
    - Select Manual
    - Delete Partitions and Partitions Table (Press D on first device - da0)
    - Create (With C)
    - Select GPT
    - Create Again - To create the partitions, First one was for partition table.
    - First Partition:
        Type: freebsd-boot
        size: 512kb
        Mountpoint And Label leave Empty
    - Second Partition:
        Type: freebsd-swap
        size: 1-2Gb (2 if you want to run vpn solution later on)
        Mountpoint And Label leave Empty
    - 3rd Partition:
        Type: freebsd-ufs
        size: The remaining Disk Space (36GB in my case)
        Mountpoint: /
        Lable: Empty
    - Finish And Commit! This will start the setup, Once done you should have a working install of PfSense on the machine.
    - Unmount the Iso Image from Cloud Console
    - Ctrl+Alt+Del in console.
    - Wait For Boot To Finish, And Do the current Steps Afterwards
        - Should VLANs be set up now: n
        - Enter the WAN interface name or 'a' for Auto Detection: vtnet0
        - Enter the LAN interface name or 'a' for Auto Detection: Leave Empty
        - do you want to proceed: y
- Wait for everything to finish, Then open browser to the Public IP
- Bypass the SSL/Security Warning in browser and login with "admin/pfsense"
- Change the admin password ASAP
- On Hetzner Cloud Console/Networks/Your Network Go to routes Tab and add the following route
    - Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
    - Gateway: PfSense Private IP/Server

All The Remaining work should be on the PfSense Web GUI :)

- Allow Public Access For HTTP And HTTPS (Can be remove later on, but for now we need to maintain access after enabling LAN interface)
    - Firewall -> Rules -> Wan
    - Add:
        Keep Everything As Is And Edit Only "Destination"
        Destination Port Range: HTTP
        Save
    - Add:
        Keep Everything As Is And Edit Only "Destination"
        Destination Port Range: HTTPS
        Save
    Apply Changes

- Add And Enable LAN Interface
    Interfaces -> Assignments
        - Click Add On vtnet1 Then Save
    Interfaces -> LAN
        - Enable interface
        - IPv4 Configuration Type: DHCP
        Leave everything else as is,save and apply changes

- Disable hardware checksum offload
    System -> Advanced -> Networking
    - Network Interfaces Section, Activate "Disable hardware checksum offload", Save And Reboot PfSense

After Reboot Is Done
- Enabling/Editing Nat
    - Firewall -> NAT -> Outbound
        - Set NAT Mode to "Hybrid"
        - Create A New Mapping Rule
            Edit "Source":
                Type: Network
                Source network for the outbound NAT mapping: 10.10.0.0/16 (Hetzner Network Subent)
                Leave Everything As Is, Save And Apply Changes

You are Now Done! You can remove the public access rules from WAN in firewall if you want to, or customize your setup with extra stuff you need.
